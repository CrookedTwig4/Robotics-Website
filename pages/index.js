            <p>
              We are a FRC Robotics team founded in 2008, by and for high school
              students. We are dedicated to giving students an experience that
              will help them in our ever-evolving world. We are a 100%
              student-run team, so students get the amazing opportunity to learn
              from their older peers and teammates. We show students what it&apos;s
              like to work on a project as a team, and how fun it is when the
              robot you built is the one that wins.
