				We are an FRC Robotics team founded in 2008, by and for high
				school students. We are dedicated to giving students an
				experience that will help them in our ever-evolving world. We
				are a 100% student-run team, so students get the amazing
				opportunity to learn from their older peers and teammates. We
				show students what it's like to work on a project as a team, and
				how fun it is when the robot you built is the one that wins.
				Since its establishment in 2007 by Jeff Bush and Richard Lin,
				the Î£-Motion team has designed and built over 10 robots which it
				used in the FIRST Competitions around the country.
